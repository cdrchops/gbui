<h3>1.1 Caveat Emptor</h3>

<p>In the words of &#8220;standtrooper&#8221;: &#8220;When BUI was written BSS
was, as best I can tell a &#8220;streamlined&#8221; or thinner version of CSS.
It never occurred to me, a web developer, that there would be Swing developers
who don't know CSS (just as there are Swing developers who
don't think that there are web developers that don't think like them.&#8221; </p>

<p>I don't consider myself to be either a web developer, or a Swing developer.
I've used CSS and am generally familiar with the concept, if
not the implementation. I've also used Swing, but not much in the last 9 years,
so my recent work with JMEDesktop was a crash-course getting reacquainted with
that. So if you don't know CSS and you don't know Swing,
don't worry: that knowledge will probably help, but I think I've got it figured
out so it can't be that hard.</p>
