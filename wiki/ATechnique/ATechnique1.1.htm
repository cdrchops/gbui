<h3><a name="_Toc212306144">1.1 Caveat Emptor</a></h3>

<p>In the words of &#8220;standtrooper&#8221;: &#8220;When BUI was written BSS
was, as best I can tell a &#8220;streamlined&#8221; or thinner version of <acronym>CSS</acronym>.
It never occurred to me, a web developer, that there would be Swing developers
who don't know <acronym>CSS</acronym> (just as there are Swing developers who
don't think that there are web developers that don't think like them <img

alt=";-)">.&#8221; </p>

<p>I don't consider myself to be either a web developer, or a Swing developer.
I've used <acronym>CSS</acronym> and am generally familiar with the concept, if
not the implementation. I've also used Swing, but not much in the last 9 years,
so my recent work with JMEDesktop was a crash-course getting reacquainted with
that. So if you don't know <acronym>CSS</acronym> and you don't know Swing,
don't worry: that knowledge will probably help, but I think I've got it figured
out so it can't be that hard.<img width=15 height=15 id="Picture 2"
